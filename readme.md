## Assignment 3 - SVG Logo Design

#### Inspiration

- My logo design inspiration comes from a previous project I worked on that involved a webpage for car rentals. This logo, I felt, would look fantastic on that webpage.

#### Process

- To create this logo, I began with simple straight lines and worked my way up till I had a skeleton of a car.

- After creating the prototype skeleton, I needed to fill in the blank places with the correct colours. But I couldn't since the void can't be filled because it's simply a collection of lines connecting rather than a whole circle or square that can be filled with desired color.

- So I fixed this problem by running over the prototype with Figma's form tool function. I just traced the empty forms using the shape tool, and there you have it: a flawless shape that can be filled with any colour.

- Another difficulty I experienced was that I made a mistake by unioning selections rather than grouping each piece independently, which would have made it easy to add different colours rather than having one colour for the entire logo. Because of this error, I only had one path in svg until Jessica showed me that it would be preferable to combine related portions in order to have multiple pathways for editing.
